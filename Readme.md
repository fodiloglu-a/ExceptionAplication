## About For Application

- This app is a special dictionary that functions like a regular dictionary. If you are learning any language, you can utilize this app.

- For instance: Let's say you have learned 5 vocabulary words 
(agg, apple, rad, big, small) and you don't want to forget these 
words. In this case, you can add them to the dictionary app and 
keep track of them.
